# Live Coding Challenge: Build a Live Search Component

## Overview

Welcome to the live coding challenge for the Senior React Developer position. In this challenge, you are tasked with building a **Live Search Component** in React that will:

- Render an input field for user search queries.
- Fetch data from an API (or simulate an API call using `setTimeout`).
- Display the list of search results.
- Implement input debouncing to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- Handle loading states and error conditions gracefully.

> **Note:** The goal is not necessarily to complete the entire solution perfectly, but to showcase your approach, coding style, and ability to discuss design tradeoffs.

## Requirements

- Use React functional components and hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- Implement debouncing to limit API calls.
- Manage asynchronous API calls with proper error handling.
- Write clean, maintainable TypeScript code.
- Consider potential extensions (e.g., cancellation of previous API calls, pagination) and discuss tradeoffs as you work.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-interview-challenge.git
